Goals {#goals}
=====

  * Resolve 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25946">bug
    25946</a> by merging this specification with the <a
    href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">URL Living Standard</a>.  Once a new
    baseline has been established, evolve the standard towards greater web
    compatibility, greater interoperability, and simpler algorithms, in that
    order.
  * Provide a
    <a href="https://github.com/rubys/url/tree/peg.js/reference-implementation">reference
    implementation</a>, where parts of this specification and parts of that
    reference implementation are generated from a
    <a href="https://github.com/rubys/url/blob/peg.js/url.pegjs">common
    source</a>.  Included in the reference implementation is a
    <a href="http://intertwingly.net/projects/pegurl/liveview.html">Live DOM URL
    Viewer</a>.
  * Integrate with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> and activate the
    <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/#Step-two%3A-Activate-GitHub-Webhook">GitHub
    WebHook</a> so that proposed changes are verified to build correctly and
    pass the relevant tests.</a>
  * Evaluate
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-uri-scheme-reg-04">draft-thaler-appsawg-uri-scheme-reg</a>
    for the scheme registration mechanism in the
    <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-writing">URL writing</a> section.
  * Explore the idea of obsoleting <em>only</em> [[rfc3987]] and not
    [[rfc3986]] too.  Consider explicitly adopting the following constraints on
      the canonicalized output of URL parsing:
      * URL parsing of canonicalized outputs roundtrip (i.e., the URL parser is
        an identity transform for such inputs).
      * All canonicalized output are valid URIs (and, if necessary, submit
        errata and/or identify specific
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#compliance-with-other-specifications">willful violations</a>).
  * Incorporate the substance of the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/references.html#refsURL">informative
    note</a> that precedes the [URL] normative reference in the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5 Recommendation</a> into a
    status section or equivalent in this document.
  * Define more soft <a>parse errors</a>.  The 
    <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">URL living standard</a> has a start,
    but based on <a href="http://intertwingly.net/projects/pegurl/urltest-results/">test
    results</a>, there clearly needs to be more.

Todos {#todos}
=====

These are items that should be done before the proposed merge:

  * Make it more clear what is normative; to be honest, I'm confused on this
    point as the only real normative requirement for the parts defined by this
    spec-let is "produce the same output as the algorithm defined herein".
  * Implement <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlutils-and-urlutilsreadonly-members">Url
    property getters and setters</a>.
  * Implement <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser">Encoding
    Override</a>.
  * Canonicalize ipv6addrs.  Example: <code>https://[12:0::1]/</code> -> 
    <code>https://[12::1]/</code>
  * Reconcile the [[#host]] parsing rules with the Encoding Living Standard
    [[!encoding]] and <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#idna">IDNA</a>.

Parsing Rules {#parsing-rules}
=============

These railroad diagrams, as modified by the accompanying text, define grammar
production rules for URLs.  They are to be evaluated sequentially, first
left-to-right then top-to-bottom, backtracking as necessary, until a complete
match against the input provided is found.

Each rule can be invoked individually.  Rules can also invoke one another.
Rules when evaluated return a JSON objection, typically either a string or an
object where all of the values are strings.  The one exception is path values,
which are arrays of strings.

Two types of <dfn>parse errors</dfn> are defined.  Hard errors (indicated in
the spec with the following text: <em>terminate processing with a parse
error</em>) are mandatory.  Soft errors (all other errors) are optional.  User
agents are encouraged to expose <a
href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#parse-error">parse errors</a> somehow.

Note: the following subsections are intended to replace steps 5-8 in the 
<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser">basic url parser</a>.  It also works out better if step 3 were to default <var>base</var> to a
non-null value, ideally one with a non-relative scheme, for example:
<code>{'scheme': 'about'}</code>.
