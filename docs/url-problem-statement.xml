    <abstract>
      <t>From a user or developer point of view, it makes no sense for there to
      be a proliferation of definitions of URL nor for there to be a
      proliferation of incompatible implementations.  This shouldn't be a
      competitive feature.  Therefore there is a need for the organizations
      involved to update and reconcile the various Internet Drafts,
      Recommendations, and Standards in this area.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Brief History of URL standards">
      <t>This section contains a very compressed history of URLs.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC1738"/> defined URLs as ASCII only.  Although it was
      quickly determined that it was desirable to allow non-ASCII characters,
      shoehorning utf-8 into ASCII-only systems was unacceptable; at the time
      Unicode was not so widely deployed, and there were other issues.  The tack
      was taken to leave "URI" alone and define a new protocol element, "IRI";
      <xref target="RFC3987"/> was published in 2005 (in sync with the 
      <xref target="RFC3986"/> update to the URI definition).</t>

      <t>The IRI-to-URI transformation specified in <xref target="RFC3987"/> had
      options; it wasn't a deterministic path. The URI-to-IRI transformation was
      also heuristic, since there was no guarantee that %xx-encoded bytes in the
      URI were actually meant to be %xx percent-hex-encoded bytes of a utf8
      encoding of a Unicode string.</t>

      <t>To address issues and to fix URL for HTML5, a new IRI working group
      &lt;<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/iri/charters">https://tools.ietf.org/wg/iri/charters</eref>&gt;
      was established in IETF in 2009.  Despite years of development, the group
      didn't get the attention of those active in WHATWG, W3C or Unicode
      consortium, and the IRI group was closed in 2014, with the consolation
      that the documents that were being developed in the IRI working group
      could be updated as individual submissions or within the "applications
      area" working group.  In particular, one of the IRI working group items
      was to update <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/>,
      which is currently under development in IETF's application area.</t>

      <t>Independently, the HTML specifications in the WHATWG and W3C redefined
      "URL" in an attempt to match what some of the browsers were doing. This
      definition (mainly a published parsing algorithm) was moved out into
      <xref target="URL-LS"/> .</t>

      <t>The world has also moved on. ICANN has approved non-ASCII top level
      domains, and neither <xref target="RFC3490"/> and <xref target="RFC5895"/>
      fully addressed IRI Encoding.  Subsequently, the Unicode consortium
      produced <xref target="UTS-46"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Current Organizations and Specs in Development">
      <t>There are multiple umbrella organizations which have
      produced multiple documents, and it's unclear whether
      there's a trajectory to make them consistent.  This includes
      the <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/about/">IETF</eref>,
      the <eref target="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_the_WHATWG.3F">WHATWG</eref>, 
      the <eref target="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C</eref>,
      <eref target="https://specs.webplatform.org/docs/">Web
      Platform.org</eref>, and
      the <eref target="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/consort.html">Unicode
      Consortium</eref>.
      </t>

      <section title="IETF">
        <t><xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> and
        <xref target="kerwin-file-scheme"/> are under active development.</t>

        <t>The IRI working group closed, but work can continue in the APPS
        area working group. Documents sitting needing update, abandoned now,
        are three drafts (<xref target="iri-3987bis"/>, 
        <xref target="iri-comparison"/>, and
        <xref target="iri-bidi-guidelines"/>)
        intended originally to obsolete <xref target="RFC3987"/>.</t>

        <t>In addition, there's quite a bit of activity around URNs and
        library identifiers in the URN working group, work that is largely
        ignored by other organizations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="WHATWG">
        <t>The <xref target="URL-LS"/> focuses on specifying what is important
        for browsers, leaving out may of the topics in the IETF
        specifications.  Registration is not yet defined.  This work
        is based on <xref target="RFC3490"/> instead of
        <xref target="RFC5895"/>, and is intented to obsolete both
        <xref target="RFC3986"/> and <xref target="RFC3987"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="W3C">
        <t>The Web Applications Working Group, in conjuction with the TAG,
        sporadically have been republishing the WHATWG work with no
        technical content differences as <xref target="W3C-URL"/>.  There is a
        <xref target="url-workmode"/> proposal to formalize this
        relationship.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="WebPlatform">
        <t><xref target="WP-URL"/> is based on <xref target="URL-LS"/> and
        currently contains work that has yet to be folded back into the
        <xref target="URL-LS"/>.  The intent is to so do once the work is
        ready, and to actively work to keep the two versions in sync.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Unicode Consortium">
        <t><xref target="UTS-46"/> defines parameterized functions for
        mapping domain names.  <xref target="URL-LS"/> builds upon this work,
        specifying particular values to be used for these parameters.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>The main problem is conflicting specifications that don't match
        each other and overlap.</t>
      <t>Additionally, the following are issues that need to be resolves to
        make URL processing unambiguous and stable.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Nomenclature: over the years, a number of different sets of
        terminology has been used.  URL / URI / IRI is not the only difference.
        <xref target="tantek-slice"/> chronicles a number of differences.</t>

        <t>Parameterization: standards in this area need to define such
        matters as normalization forms and values for parameters such as
        UseSTD3ASCIIRules.</t>

        <t>Interoperability: even after accounting for the above, there
        is a demonstrable lack of interoperability across popular libraries
        and browsers.  <xref target="whatwg-interop"/> identifies a number
        of such differences.</t>
      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Outline of Potential Solution">
      <t>This problem clearly requires a cross-organizational solution,
        specifically:</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Build a plan to update or obsolete <xref target="RFC3986"/>,
          <xref target="RFC3987"/>, <xref target="RFC5895"/>, and
          <xref target="kerwin-file-scheme"/> to be consistent with
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> and <xref target="UTS-46"/>.  This
          may involve working to get the other specifications updated.</t>
        <t>Change the <xref target="URL-LS"/> goals to only obsolete
          specifications listed above that are not updated.  Presuming that
          <xref target="RFC3986"/> is updated, explicitly state that 
          canonical URLs (i.e., the outout of the URL parser) not only
          round trip, but also are valid URIs.</t>
        <t>Reconcile how <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> and
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> handle currently unknown schemes,
          update <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> to state that
          registration applies to both URIs and URLs, and update
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> to indicate that
          <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> is how you register
          schemes.</t>
        <t>Have the W3C adopt <xref target="url-workmode"/>.</t>
        <t>Other than responsing to any feedback that may be provided,
          no changes to any Unicode Consortium product is required.</t>
      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>In addition to the security exposures created when URLs work
      differently in different systems, all of the security considerations
      defined in <xref target="RFC3490"/>, <xref target="RFC3986"/>, 
      <xref target="RFC3987"/>, and <xref target="RFC5895"/> apply to URLs.</t>
