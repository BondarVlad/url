    <abstract>
      <t>This document lays out the problem space of possibly conflicting
      standards between multiple organizations for URLs and things like
      them, and proposes some actions to resolve the conflicts.
      From a user or developer point of view, it makes no sense for there to
      be a proliferation of definitions of URL nor for there to be a
      proliferation of incompatible implementations.  This shouldn't be a
      competitive feature.  Therefore there is a need for the organizations
      involved to update and reconcile the various Internet Drafts,
      Recommendations, and Standards in this area.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Brief History of URL standards">
      <t>This section contains a very compressed history of URL standards,
        in sufficient detail to set some context.
      </t>

      <t>The first standards-track specification for URLs was <xref target="RFC1738"/>
      in 1994. (That spec contains more background material.)
      It defined URLs as ASCII only. Although it was
      quickly determined that it was desirable to allow non-ASCII characters,
      shoehorning utf-8 into ASCII-only systems was unacceptable; at the time
      Unicode was not so widely deployed.  The tack
      was taken to leave "URI" alone and define a new protocol element, "IRI";
      <xref target="RFC3987"/> was published in 2005 (in sync with the 
      <xref target="RFC3986"/> update to the URI definition).</t>

      <t>The IRI-to-URI transformation specified in <xref target="RFC3987"/> had
      options; it wasn't a deterministic path. The URI-to-IRI transformation was
      also heuristic, since there was no guarantee that %xx-encoded bytes in the
      URI were actually meant to be %xx percent-hex-encoded bytes of a utf8
      encoding of a Unicode string.</t>

      <t>To address issues and to fix URL for HTML5, a new IRI working group
      &lt;<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/iri/charters">https://tools.ietf.org/wg/iri/charters</eref>&gt;
      was established in IETF in 2009.  Despite years of development, 
      the IRI group was closed in 2014, with the consolation
      that the documents that were being developed in the IRI working group
      could be updated as individual submissions or within the "applications
      area" working group.  In particular, one of the IRI working group items
      was to update <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/>,
      which is currently under development in IETF's application area.</t>

      -->

      <t>Independently, the HTML specifications in the WHATWG and W3C redefined
      "URL" in an attempt to match what some of the browsers were doing. This
      definition was moved out into the "URL - Living Standard"
      <xref target="URL-LS"/> .</t>

      <t>The world has also moved on. ICANN has approved non-ASCII top level
      domains, but IDNA specs (<xref target="RFC3490"/> and <xref target="RFC5895"/>)
      did not fully addressed IRI processing.  Subsequently, the Unicode consortium
      produced <xref target="UTS-46"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Current Organizations and Specs in Development">
      <t>There are multiple umbrella organizations which have
      produced multiple documents, and it's unclear whether
      there's a trajectory to make them consistent.  This section
      tries to enumerate currently active organizations and specs.
      </t>
      <t>Organizations include
      the <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/about/">IETF</eref>,
      the <eref target="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_the_WHATWG.3F">WHATWG</eref>, 
      the <eref target="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C</eref>,
      <eref target="https://specs.webplatform.org/docs/">Web
      Platform.org</eref>, and
      the <eref target="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/consort.html">Unicode
      Consortium</eref>.
      Relevant specs under development in each organization include:</t>

      <section title="IETF">
        <t><xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> and
        <xref target="kerwin-file-scheme"/> are under active development.</t>

        <t>The IRI working group closed, but work can continue in the Applications
        Area working group. Documents sitting needing update, abandoned now,
        are three drafts (<xref target="iri-3987bis"/>, 
        <xref target="iri-comparison"/>, and
        <xref target="iri-bidi-guidelines"/>), which were
        originally intended to obsolete <xref target="RFC3987"/>.</t>

        <t>In addition, there's quite a bit of activity around URNs and
        library identifiers in the URN working group, including
        some expressions of desire to update RFC 3986 to better accomodate
        desired URN semantics.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="WHATWG">
        <t>The <xref target="URL-LS"/> is being developed as a
        <eref target="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_does_.22Living_Standard.22_mean.3F">living standard</eref>.
        It primarily focuses on specifying what is important
        for browsers.   The means by which new schemes might be
        registered is not yet defined.  This work
        is based on <xref target="UTS-46"/>, and is intented to obsolete both
        <xref target="RFC3986"/> and <xref target="RFC3987"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="W3C">
        <t>The <eref target="http://www.w3.org/2014/06/webapps-charter.html">Web 
        Applications Working Group</eref>, in conjuction with the 
        <eref target="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">W3C TAG</eref>,
        sporadically have been republishing the WHATWG work with no
        technical content differences as <xref target="W3C-URL"/>.  There is a
        <xref target="url-workmode"/> proposal to formalize this
        relationship.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="WebPlatform">
        <t><xref target="WP-URL"/> is being developed on a
        <eref target="https://specs.webplatform.org/#how">develop</eref>
        GitHub branch based on <xref target="URL-LS"/>.  It
        currently contains work that has yet to be folded back into the
        <xref target="URL-LS"/>, primarily to rewrite the parser logic
        in a way that is more understandable and approachable.  The intent is
        to merge this work once it is ready, and to actively work to keep the
        two versions in sync.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Unicode Consortium">
        <t><xref target="UTS-46"/> defines parameterized functions for
        mapping domain names.  <xref target="URL-LS"/> builds upon this work,
        specifying particular values to be used for these parameters.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Problem Statements">
      <t>The main problem is conflicting specifications that overlap
      but don't match each other.</t>
      <t>Additionally, the following are issues that need to be resolves to
        make URL processing unambiguous and stable.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Nomenclature: over the years, a number of different sets of
        terminology has been used.  URL / URI / IRI is not the only difference.
        <xref target="tantek-slice"/> chronicles a number of differences.</t>

        <t>Parameterization: standards in this area need to define such
        matters as normalization forms and values for parameters such as
        UseSTD3ASCIIRules.</t>

        <t>Interoperability: even after accounting for the above, there
        is a demonstrable lack of interoperability across popular libraries
        and browsers.  <xref target="whatwg-interop"/> identifies a number
        of such differences.</t>
        
        <t>Specific scheme definitions: some UR* scheme definitions are woefully
          out of date, incomplete, or don't correspond to current practice,
          but updating their definitions is unclear. This includes "file:",
          for which there is a current effort, but there are others which
          need review (including 'ftp:', 'data').
        </t>
      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Outline of Potential Solution">
      <t>This problem clearly requires a cross-organizational solution,
        specifically:</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Build a plan to update or obsolete <xref target="RFC3986"/>,
          <xref target="RFC3987"/>, <xref target="RFC5895"/>, and
          <xref target="kerwin-file-scheme"/> to be consistent with
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> and <xref target="UTS-46"/>.  This
          may involve working to get the other specifications updated,
            if only to clarify nomenclature.
          </t>
        <t>Change the <xref target="URL-LS"/> goals to only obsolete
          specifications listed above that are not updated.  Presuming that
          <xref target="RFC3986"/> is updated, explicitly state that 
          canonical URLs (i.e., the outout of the URL parser) not only
          round trip, but also are valid URIs.</t>
        <t>Reconcile how <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> and
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> handle currently unknown schemes,
          update <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> to state that
          registration applies to both URIs and URLs, and update
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> to indicate that
          <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> is how you register
          schemes.</t>
        <t>Have the W3C adopt <xref target="url-workmode"/>.</t>
        <t>Other than responsing to any feedback that may be provided,
          no changes to any Unicode Consortium product is required.</t>

      <t>This memo currently includes no request to IANA,
        although an updated <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/>

        <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">IANA
          URI scheme registry</eref> to make clear that the

      defined in <xref target="RFC3490"/>, <xref target="RFC3986"/>, 
      <xref target="RFC3987"/>, and <xref target="RFC5895"/> apply to URLs.</t>
