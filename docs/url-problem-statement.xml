      <t>This document lays out the problem space around
      standards for URLs and things like

      From a user or developer point of view, it makes no sense for there to
      be a proliferation of definitions of URL nor for there to be a

    <section title="Brief History of URL Standards">
      <t>This section contains a very compressed history of URL standards,
        in sufficient detail to set some context.
	REVIEWERS: history is necessarily incomplete, but please
	note incorrect or missing essential facts.
      </t>

      <t>The first standards-track specification for URLs was <xref target="RFC1738"/>
      in 1994. (That spec contains more background material.)
      It defined URLs as ASCII only. Although it was
      quickly determined that it was desirable to allow non-ASCII characters,
      shoehorning UTF-8 into ASCII-only systems was unacceptable; at the time
      Unicode was not so widely deployed.  The tack
      was taken to leave "URI" alone and define a new protocol element, "IRI";
      <xref target="RFC3987"/> was published in 2005 (in sync with the 
      <xref target="RFC3986"/> update to the URI definition).
      <!-- we probably should mention RFC2396 which separated the generic syntax from concrete scheme definitions -->
      </t>

      <t>The IRI-to-URI transformation specified in <xref target="RFC3987"/> had
      options; it wasn't a deterministic path. The URI-to-IRI transformation was
      also heuristic, since there was no guarantee that %xx-encoded bytes in the
      URI were actually meant to be %xx percent-hex-encoded bytes of a UTF-8
      encoding of a Unicode string.</t>

      <t>To address issues and to fix URL for HTML5, a new IRI working group
      &lt;<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/iri/charters">https://tools.ietf.org/wg/iri/charters</eref>&gt;
      was established in the IETF in 2009.  Despite years of development, 
      the IRI group was closed in 2014, with the consolation
      that the documents that were being developed in the IRI working group
      could be updated as individual submissions or within the "applications
      area" working group.  In particular, one of the IRI working group items
      was to update <xref target="RFC4395"/>,
      which is currently under development in IETF's application area
      (see <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/>).</t>
      <!--

        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-iri/2010Apr/0008.html
      -->

      <t>Independently, the HTML specifications in the WHATWG and W3C redefined
      "URL" in an attempt to match what some of the browsers were doing. This
      definition was moved out into the "URL - Living Standard"
      <xref target="URL-LS"/>.</t>

      <t>When W3C produced <eref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">the HTML5
      recommendation</eref>, the normative
      reference to the WHATWG URL standard was a gating issue, and
      <eref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/references.html#refsURL">an
      unusual compromised was reached</eref>, where the [URL] reference is given a descriptive
      paragraph rather than a single document reference.
      </t>

      <t>The world has moved on in other ways. ICANN has approved non-ASCII top level
      domains, but IDNA specs (<xref target="RFC3490"/> and <xref target="RFC5895"/>)
      did not fully addressed IRI processing.  Subsequently, the Unicode consortium
      produced <xref target="UTS-46"/>.</t>

    <section title="Current Organizations and Specs in Development">
      <t>There are multiple umbrella organizations which have
      produced multiple documents, and it's unclear whether
      there's a trajectory to make them consistent.  This section
      tries to enumerate currently active organizations and specs.
      REVIEWERS: are there important ongoing activities we've missed
      or gotten wrong? Who are the stakeholders whose current
      work might be affected? (This is to scope organizational
      coordination needed.)
      </t>
      <t>Organizations include
      the <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/about/">IETF</eref>,
      the <eref target="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_the_WHATWG.3F">WHATWG</eref>, 
      the <eref target="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C</eref>,
      <eref target="https://specs.webplatform.org/docs/">Web
      Platform.org</eref>, and
      the <eref target="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/consort.html">Unicode
      Consortium</eref>.
      Relevant specs under development in each organization include:</t>

      <section title="IETF">
        <t><xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> has
	passed working group last call and entered IESG 
	review.</t>

	<t>New schemes and updates to old ones continue, including 
	'file:' <xref target="kerwin-file-scheme"/> 
	and 'urn:'. </t>

        <t>The IRI working group closed, but work can continue in the Applications
        Area working group. Documents sitting needing update, abandoned now,
        are three drafts (<xref target="iri-3987bis"/>, 
        <xref target="iri-comparison"/>, and
        <xref target="iri-bidi-guidelines"/>), which were
        originally intended to obsolete <xref target="RFC3987"/>.</t>
	
	<t>The <eref target="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/urnbis/charter/">URNBis
	working group</eref> has been working to update the definitions
	of URNs, but has difficulty with some of the wording in RFC 3986.
	In particular, <eref target="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-urnbis-semantics-clarif/"/> updates RFC3986.
        </t>
	
	<t>The web security working group developed
	RFC 6454 ("The Web Origin Concept"), which 
	<xref target="URL-LS"/> redefines. Updates
	in the IETF were abandoned.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="WHATWG">
        <t>The <xref target="URL-LS"/> is being developed as a
        <eref target="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_does_.22Living_Standard.22_mean.3F">living standard</eref>.
        It primarily focuses on specifying what is important
        for browsers.   The means by which new schemes might be
        registered is not yet defined.  This work
        is based on <xref target="UTS-46"/>, and is intented to obsolete both
        <xref target="RFC3986"/> and <xref target="RFC3987"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="W3C">
        <t>The <eref target="http://www.w3.org/2014/06/webapps-charter.html">Web 
        Applications Working Group</eref>
        sporadically have been republishing the WHATWG work with no
        technical content differences as <xref target="W3C-URL"/>.  There is a
        <xref target="url-workmode"/> proposal to formalize this
        relationship.</t>

	<t>The W3C TAG developed
	<eref target="http://www.w3.org/TR//fragid-best-practices/">
	  Best Practices for Fragment Identifiers and Media Type Definitions
	</eref>, which points out several problems with the definitions
	for the 'fragment' part of URLs.  The TAG is working to
	insure liaison exchange happens.</t>
	
	<t>Note also the interim solution for <eref
	target="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/references.html#refsURL">the
	HTML5 reference to [URL]</eref>, which should be updated by
	<eref target="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">the HTML working
	group </eref>.</t>

      <section title="WebPlatform">
        <t>WebPlatform.org is an activity sponsored by <eref 
	target="http://www.webplatform.org">W3C and web vendors</eref>.
	<xref target="WP-URL"/> is being developed on a
        <eref target="https://specs.webplatform.org/#how">develop</eref>
        GitHub branch based on <xref target="URL-LS"/>.  It
        currently contains work that has yet to be folded back into the
        <xref target="URL-LS"/>, primarily to rewrite the parser logic
        in a way that is more understandable and approachable.  The intent is
        to merge this work once it is ready, and to actively work to keep the
        two versions in sync.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Unicode Consortium">
        <t><xref target="UTS-46"/> defines parameterized functions for
        mapping domain names.  <xref target="URL-LS"/> builds upon this work,
        specifying particular values to be used for these parameters.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Problem Statements">
      <t>This section lays out the problems we see need a coordinated
       solution. REVIEWERS: have we missed some things? Are any of these
       non-problems or not worth solving? </t>

       <t>The main problem is conflicting specifications that overlap
       but don't match each other.</t>
       <t>Additionally, the following are issues that need to be resolved to
       make URL processing unambiguous and stable.</t>
       
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Nomenclature: over the years, a number of different sets of
        terminology has been used.  URL / URI / IRI is not the only difference.
        <xref target="tantek-slice"/> chronicles a number of differences.</t>
	
        <t>Parameterization: standards in this area need to define such
        matters as normalization forms and values for parameters such as
        UseSTD3ASCIIRules.</t>

        <t>Interoperability: even after accounting for the above, there
        is a demonstrable lack of interoperability across popular libraries
        and browsers.  <xref target="whatwg-interop"/> identifies a number
        of such differences.</t>
        
	<t>IDNA: RFC 3490 (IDNA) defines processing for 'IDN-aware
	domain name slots' (where "the host portion of the URI in the
	src attribute of an HTML &lt;IMG&gt; tag" is given as an
	example. Later, "IDNA is applicable to all domain names in all
	domain name slots". So in mailto:user@host, is the host a
	IDN-aware domain name slot? A domain name slot at all?  </t>

        <t>Specific scheme definitions: some UR* scheme definitions are woefully
          out of date, incomplete, or don't correspond to current practice,
          but updating their definitions is unclear. This includes "file:",
          for which there is a current effort, but there are others which
          need review (including 'ftp:', 'data').
        </t>
      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="nextsteps" title="Potential Solution">
      <t>Many of the problem above require some cross-organizational collaboration.
      This section outlines alternatives and possible next steps.
      REVIEWERS: Neccessary? Sufficient? What are we missing, what
      did we get wrong?
      </t>
      <section title="Leave, Update or Obsolete RFC 3986 (URI)">
	<t>At various times, many have called for replacing
	the IETF URI standard RFC 3986, or updating it. How
	to approach this is controversal, but at a minimum
	the following are needed:
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Make it clear that ASCII-only URIs (as now defined
	  by RFC 3986) are not what is mainly used on the web. </t>
	  <t>Updates for URN.</t>
	  <t>Updates for fragment identifier semantics.</t>
	  <t>Note terminology issue and resolution.</t>
	</list>
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Obsolete RFC 3987 (IRI)"> <t>
	After insuring that topics covered in RFC 3987 are
	also covered by the W3C URL recommendation, then
	mark 3987 as obsolete with a short RFC noting
	the conditions laid out in this document.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Obsolete RFC 6454 (Origin)">
	<t>
	  Replaced by <xref target="URL-LS"/>.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="file: URI scheme">
	<t> 
	  Coordinate 'file:' syntax in <xref target="URL-LS"/>
	  and <xref target="kerwin-file-scheme"/>, possibly
	  moving the file: Partr of URL-LS into a separate
	  document.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Other actions">
	
	<t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Update <xref target="RFC5895"/>, and
          to be consistent with
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> and <xref target="UTS-46"/>.  This
          may involve working to get the other specifications updated,
          if only to clarify nomenclature.
          </t>
	  <t>Obsolete any previous definition of x-url-encoded. </t>
	    
          <t>Change the <xref target="URL-LS"/> goals to only obsolete
          specifications listed above that are not updated.  Presuming that
          <xref target="RFC3986"/> is updated, explicitly state that 
          canonical URLs (i.e., the output of the URL parser) not only
          round trip, but also are valid URIs.</t>
        <t>Update and incorporate (or reference) the content currently
          present in <xref target="tantek-slice"/>, probably as an appendix
          to <xref target="URL-LS"/>, so that readers will understand
          what terms are in use and how they map.</t>
        <t>Reconcile how <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> and

          update <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> to state that
          registration applies to both URIs and URLs, and update
          <xref target="URL-LS"/> to indicate that
          <xref target="appsawg-uri-scheme-reg"/> is how you register
