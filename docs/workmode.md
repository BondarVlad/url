Preface
---

Please read this proposal carefully.

  * It may contain elements that strongly resemble proposals made and rejected years ago.  Times have changed.  I ask everybody to evaluate this proposal anew, and not dwell on the past.

  * It may contain elements that strongly resemble proposals made within the past few weeks.  It may also be missing crucial elements from those proposals.  I ask that everybody evaluate this proposal as a standalone proposal.

WorkMode
===

The [W3C Web Applications  Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/) has a published [WorkMode](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/WorkMode).  This is the WorkMode for the URL work during the 2015-2016 calendar years.  Extensions, early termination, and adoption of some or all of this by other efforts are all possible, but outside of the scope of this document.

Participation and Communication
---

The primary place for work on the URL standard has been, and continues to be:

  * [WHATWG Mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/) hosted by the W3C
  * [WHATWG/URL component in Bugzilla](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?component=URL&list_id=48297&product=WHATWG&resolution=---) hosted by the W3C
  * [whatwg/url repository](https://github.com/whatwg/url) hosted by GitHub
  * [#whatwg IRC channel](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC) hosted by freenode

All technical communications are to take place on a publicly archived list.  As an example, this includes [www-archive](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/).  In general, the editors intend to aggressively follow up with any individual or group that has technical input and will bring the results of those efforts back to the venues mentioned above.  The current list of alternate venues being evaluated:

  * [webspecs/url repository](https://github.com/webspecs/url) hosted by GitHub

The Technical Reports Process (What is an Editor's Draft?)
---

[Prior efforts](http://www.w3.org/TR/url/) to participate in the [W3C Technical Report process](http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#Reports) have stalled.

The [URL Living Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) is effectively an [Public Working Draft](http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#revised-wd) and matches the description of an [Editor's draft](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/WorkMode#The_Technical_Reports_Process_.28What_is_an_Editor.27s_Draft.3F.29) as practiced by the WebApps WG.

There have been discussions concerning having a W3C Working Group such as WebApps "sponsor" this effort; such a decision would be an entirely voluntary one by the WebApps working group.

This would involve the Working Group producing [Transition Requests](http://www.w3.org/2005/08/01-transitions.html#transreq).  Items that would need to be worked:

  * How and if snapshots are made and where they are to be hosted.
  * Stylesheets, or lack thereof
  * Pubrules changed needed to make this work.
  * Possible differences in normative references - [W3C Normative References Policy](http://www.w3.org/2013/09/normative-references)
  * License under which the snapshot is made available.

The WebApps Working Group would also need to record and present [Formal Objections](http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#FormalObjection).  It is conceivable that the resolution of such a Formal Objection could result in a fork.  The process by which such a potential fork would be managed is outside of the scope of this document.

Editors
---

In the W3C, editors are [appointed by WG chairs](http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#general-requirements).  In the WHATWG editors agree to add other editors.  Ideally, the way to make this work is for the W3C chairs of the WebApps working group voluntarily agree to limit their activities to confirming changes to editors, and for us to not spend time working out the implications of what would happen if such a change were not confirmed.

There is no predefined criteria for becoming an editor.  The most common way for this to occur is after a sustained period of producing quality pull requests.

Bugs, Issues and Actions
---

[Bugzilla](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?component=URL&list_id=48297&product=WHATWG&resolution=---) and [github issues](https://github.com/webspecs/url/issues) are used by the URL Standard.

The WebApps working group may chose to track [actions items](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/track/).

Patent Policy
---

This is general agreement on [Royalty Free Licensing](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Requirements) and [Disclosure](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-disclosure-requirements) requirements.  In practice, agreeing to join the relevant Working Group is a part of collecting the necessary commitments.  Unfortunately, there is a pervasive perception that the necessary agreements to do so impose requirements inconsistent with the working mode described on this page.  Specifically:

  * The [Invited Expert and Collaborator Agreement](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2014/08-invited-expert.html) explicitly disallows «Branching», which would seem to preclude [GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

  * While the [W3C Member Agreement](http://www.w3.org/2009/12/Member-Agreement) is only publicly visible in draft form, it has been reported at various times that the actual agreement that members have signed does not permit activities that seem similar to the WorkMode as described on this page.

An alternate approach that has been tried in the past is to use the CG process to obtain [licensing commitments](http://www.w3.org/community/whatwg/spec/82/commitments).

For URL to become a W3C Recommendation, the W3C will need to define a workable process that gets the necessary commitments without imposing unrelated requirements.  That may require the drafting of new agreements, or modification of existing agreements.  It may also require a review of the actual Member Agreements that are in place by someone who has access to this information and a public and authoritative statement that such agreements are not in conflict with the Work Mode as described on this page.

Limiting the scope of new or modified agreements to a period of time or to this specific work product may be worth exploring.

Also worth noting, the [acknowledgements](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#acknowledgments) section contains a list of people who have already contributed.

Meetings
---

No telecons have been held or are expected.

Discussions on [#whatwg IRC channel](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC) are commonplace.

URL has been a topic of discussion at F2F meetings such as TPAC.  As is the custom with WebApps, any results are to be taken back to public mailing lists.

Consensus and Call for Consensus
---

The only Calls for Consensus by the WebApps working group relating to URL will be for process related items: decisions to "sponsor" this work, decisions related to transition requests, and decisions to host a fork of this product.  Going into this agreement, everybody agrees that such a fork is a measure of last resort.

Mail List Policy
---

Discussions that are held in various venues will conform to the norms expected of those venues.  No additional URL specific mailing list policies are being proposed or are expected.

Off-Topic Discussion Policy
---

Again, discussions that are held in various venues will conform to the norms expected of those venues.  As those venues generally are not limited in scope to the URL standard, messages on such lists may be unrelated to the URL standard.

IRC
---

Discussions related to the URL standard occur on [#whatwg IRC channel](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC).

Testing
---

Tests can be found in the [url/](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/url) directory of [w3c/web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).

Version Control
---

[whatwg/url](https://github.com/whatwg/url) and [webspecs/url](https://github.com/webspecs/url) repositories on GitHub are currently being actively used.  Neither consistently are "upstream" from each other, and the plans are to actively keep them in sync.

Links to Group Resources
