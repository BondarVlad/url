# Historical note: I started this effort by attempting to create a
# faithful implmentation of the URL Standard:
#
#   http://intertwingly.net/stories/2014/10/13/url_rb.html
#
# Like others who attempted to do so[1], I found the current description
# to appear to be easy to follow yet when I attempted to do so I found
# I had a hard time determing what should be the parsing output for
# a number of cases.  I ended up reverse engineering the outputs,
# and actually reading the source code, of other implementations.
#
# This kinda defeats the purpose of a Spec.
#
# I then embarked on an effort to define a formal grammar and selected
# PEG.js.  For the parts which aren't covered by the grammar, I used a
# path of least resistance: a tool to convert Ruby to JS.  
#
#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'ruby2js'
require 'ruby2js/filter/functions'
require 'ruby2js/filter/camelCase'

source = File.read(ARGV.first)

converted = Ruby2JS.convert(source)

# Unicode transendent charcters => UTF 16 surrogate pairs
converted.gsub! /\\\\u\{.*?\]/, '\\\\\\uD800-\\\\\\uDFFF]'

print converted
